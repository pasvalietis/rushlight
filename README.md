# Rushlight: an emission modeling package to generate synthetic solar observational data from numerical models

## Aim
Compute synthetic emissivities from physical parameters that are stored in 3D MHD/particle datasets to further create synthetic images that can be compared with observations.

Currently available instruments are:
* **SDO/AIA**
* **Hinode/XRT**

These codes utilize functionality provided by the [yt](https://yt-project.org/) and [sunpy](https://sunpy.org/) packages.
